Welcome to the awesome asset pipeline for the fogsync client that is totally
not hacked together out of crazy Make variables with embedded perl commands.

Stuff to edit lives in "css", "html", and "js" directories.

Stuff to not edit because it's automatically populated lives
in the "public" directory.

Once you've made changes, type "make" and everything should be regenerated as
nessisary. If you add new scss, hbs, or coffee files in the right place the
Makefile will find them.
